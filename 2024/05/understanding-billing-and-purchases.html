<!--more-->
<h2>What is a "Free to Play" Game?</h2>

<p>Wizard of Oz Slots is a "Free to Play" game, which means you can download and enjoy the entire game without paying a single penny. However, the game offers optional in-game purchases that allow you to enhance your gaming experience by acquiring virtual goods or unlocking additional features.</p>

<h2>Billing Phone Support Hotline</h2>

<p>If you encounter any billing-related issues or have questions regarding purchases, Zynga provides a dedicated Billing Phone Support Hotline. This hotline is available from 5:00 AM to 11:00 PM, Monday to Sunday, Pacific Standard Time. You can access the support by navigating to the game settings, locating the "Help" or "Support" option, and selecting the "Contact" feature.</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>Please note that the Billing Phone Support Hotline is available only in English, and it focuses specifically on billing-related queries.</p>

<h2>Purchasing Virtual Goods</h2>

<h2>Taxes and Fees</h2>

<p>Depending on your location, taxes may be applied to your Zynga purchases. The price displayed on the purchase page will include any applicable taxes for your area. Taxes are applied based on the geographic location of your Internet-connected device.</p>

<p>For international purchases, applicable taxes or VAT will be included in the purchase price for certain countries, including Albania, Armenia, Australia, Belarus, the European Union, Iceland, India, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the United Arab Emirates.</p>

<h2>Promotions and Sales</h2>

<p>Zynga may occasionally offer limited-time promotions or sales within the game or on the add coin or cash page. These promotions and sales vary depending on the game, your gameplay, and will be available for a limited time only. Unfortunately, Zynga cannot issue refunds, credits, or extra points for purchases made before or after the promotion has expired.</p>

<h2>Redeeming Gift Cards</h2>

<p>If you have an Apple (iTunes) Gift Card, you can redeem it and use the credits in your game. Here's how:</p>

<p>For iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Open the App Store app.</li>
	<li>Tap "Today," then tap your photo in the upper-right corner.</li>
	<li>Tap "Redeem Gift Card or Code," then sign in with your Apple ID.</li>
	<li>Follow the on-screen instructions to redeem your gift card using the camera or enter the code manually.</li>
</ol>

<p>For Mac or PC:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Open iTunes and sign in with your Apple ID.</li>
	<li>From the menu bar, choose "Account" &gt; "Redeem."</li>
	<li>Sign in with your Apple ID.</li>
	<li>Follow the on-screen instructions to redeem your gift card using the camera or enter the code manually.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once redeemed, the store credit will be used for each purchase you make in any of the stores, including Apple Music subscriptions and iCloud storage, until it's gone.</p>

<h2>Managing Subscriptions</h2>

<p>Some Zynga games and apps offer subscriptions that allow you to set up monthly recurring payments. If you've set up a subscription, you can cancel it at any time by following these steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Visit your payment settings.</li>
	<li>Under "Subscriptions," click "Deactivate" next to the subscription you want to cancel.</li>
</ol>

<p>The cancellation of your subscription will become effective at the end of your current billing period, ensuring you continue to receive the subscription benefits until then.</p>
