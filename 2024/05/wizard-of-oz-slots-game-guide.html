  <h2>Events and Features</h2>

  <h3>Enchanted Vaults</h3>
  <p>Enchanted Vaults is a thrilling feature that rewards you with additional prizes after achieving big wins in the game. Whenever you score a Mega Win or higher, you'll receive a beautiful vault containing extra prizes. There are four different types of vaults: common, uncommon, rare, and rainbow. The higher your bet, the better the chances of getting better prizes in the vault. You can store up to four vaults at a time, and if you receive a fifth vault, you'll need to decide whether to give up the new one or open an existing vault immediately.</p>

  <h3>Jackpot Days</h3>
  <p>Jackpot Days is a time-limited event that gives you the opportunity to enter a jackpot and win big when you purchase eligible credit packages on the Buy Page. After making an eligible purchase, you'll automatically be entered into a jackpot. The larger the credit package you buy, the higher your chances of winning the jackpot. If you don't win the jackpot, you'll receive a consolation prize.</p>

  <h3>Wicked Tower</h3>
  <p>Wicked Tower is a daily challenge where you climb the Tower of the Wicked Witch, choosing prizes on each floor. If you reach the top floor or decide to cash out early, you'll earn all the prizes you've picked. However, be cautious, as the Wicked Witch may catch you, causing you to lose your collected prizes. You can use Gems to continue playing if caught.</p>

  <h3>Trail of Wonder</h3>
  <p>Trail of Wonder is a multi-day event where your goal is to travel down the Trail of Wonder by collecting tokens earned from spinning on any machine. As you progress down the trail, you'll earn fabulous prizes. Bigger bets earn tokens faster, and completing the trail grants you additional rewards.</p>

  <h3>Rainbow Rush</h3>
  <p>Rainbow Rush is a real-time weekly competition where you compete against other players on your division leaderboard. Win credits from spinning on any machine to move up the leaderboard. Finish in the Promotion Zone to move up the divisions for better rewards, including larger Buy Bonuses and Hourly Bonuses. If you finish in the Drop Zone, you'll be demoted to a lower division.</p>

  <h3>Glinda's Jackpot Wheel</h3>
  <p>Glinda's Jackpot Wheel is a High Roller World event where you spin wheels with Glinda to win Jackpots and Multipliers. Fill up your Heart Meter by spinning in High Roller World machines to access the wheels. Landing on Jackpot wedges will take you to higher-tier wheels with bigger Multipliers. Collect Jackpots to complete your Rewards Card and win the Grand Prize.</p>

  <h3>Emerald City Empire</h3>
  <p>Emerald City Empire is a multi-day event where you build and expand the Emerald City from a small settlement. As you improve the city, the Credit Bank will accumulate more credits for you to collect periodically. You can upgrade buildings by spending Emeralds found while spinning on any machine and earn rewards for leveling up and expanding your city.</p>

  <h3>Prestige</h3>
  <p>Prestige is a rewards program that provides players with exclusive benefits for playing Wizard of Oz Slots. You can earn Prestige Points through credit purchases, spinning on machines, and completing challenges. Accumulating enough Prestige Points will grant you a Prestige Membership Pass, which unlocks benefits like Daily Credits Back on every bet, Free Gifts on credit purchases, and Daily Surprise Gifts.</p>

  <h3>Minigames</h3>
  <p>Most machines in Wizard of Oz Slots offer an On-Reel Picker Minigame, where you can pick a prize from three choices. Some machines also feature Unique Minigames, which are detailed in the Paytable and instructions for each machine.</p>

  <h3>Clubs</h3>
  <p>Clubs is a social feature that connects you with a group of other players. You can invite your Facebook friends to join your Club and collect rewards when your Clubmates win big. Club members can also send gifts to each other without counting towards the daily gift limit.</p>

  <h3>Trophies</h3>
  <p>The Trophies feature allows you to collect Trophies by completing various achievements. Visit your Profile to check the available Trophies and the tasks required to earn them. Each Trophy has points that contribute to increasing your Trophy ranking.</p>

  <h3>Bonus Buddy</h3>
  <p>Bonus Buddy is your little companion that provides amazing perks if you keep it active. Feed your Buddy banana treats to activate perks like Increased Hourly Bonus, Banana Respin (turning losing spins into winning ones), and Banana Bonus (credit rewards on spins). Leveling up your Buddy permanently boosts these perks.</p>

  <h3>Daily Challenges Deluxe</h3>
  <p>Daily Challenges Deluxe is a set of fun challenges you can complete to earn prizes. Complete Daily Challenges for smaller prizes and Deluxe Points, and Seasonal Challenges for larger prizes and more Deluxe Points. Accumulate Deluxe Points to progress on the Prizes meter and unlock milestones, including Elite Prizes if you purchase the Elite Pass.</p>

  <h3>Explore A Board</h3>
  <p>Explore A Board is a multi-day board game event where your goal is to make it to the center of the board by spinning a wheel and moving spaces. Reach the center to earn the Board Reward and move on to a new board with bigger prizes. You can earn additional rewards by landing on certain spaces, such as Credits Reward, Reward Up, and Mystery Reward spaces.</p>

  <h3>Horsey Bank</h3>
  <p>The Horsey Bank is your personal bank that fills up with credits when you spin on a machine or complete a purchase. Once the bank is full, you'll receive a special offer to claim all the credits inside.
